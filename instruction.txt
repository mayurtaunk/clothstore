how to show error on the form?
example ->  invalid mobile number
 bank account detail form-
data male che badho but fill kem karvno form ma edit/1 pr


go thru set_trans fucntion in radhe.php


be specific with table, field, variable, controller, view names

table name plural 
and its fields are with specifc name 
all contoller name are singular name and its view is with same name ending with _edit

and not like bank and add_bank but bank and bank_edit

delete both view and controller you made 

make account and account_edit, transaction and transaction_edit

drop bank tables and forward accounts, transactions brom workbanch

and do the needed changes ;)
